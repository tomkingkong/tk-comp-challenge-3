#### My goal for this project was to push my CSS skills and create a functional recreation. 
#### This included a collapsable container for the graphs, as well as popup windows over the bar graph.
### This project was created using only pure CSS

### [Demo](https://tomkingkong.github.io/tk-comp-challenge-3/)
